## Project Overview

**bloompschmapf** is a small Python framework for running a *scheduled "search + summarize + notify" agent*.

A bloompschmapf agent is configured to:
1) search online for new items matching a topic (e.g., songs in a niche genre, calls for papers in a field, lawsuits in certain jurisdictions) from the last **X days**,
2) deduplicate and rank results by estimated relevance/importance,
3) produce a concise report with linked references,
4) deliver the report via **email** and/or **Telegram**.

- **Primary Language:** Python 3.11+ (preferred), 3.10 acceptable
- **Core concepts:** Agent config, Sources (search providers), Extractors, Ranker, Summarizer, Report renderer, Notifiers, Scheduler
- **Runtime modes:** CLI (run once), daemon scheduler (continuous), container-friendly
- **No secrets in repo:** all credentials via env vars or external secret manager

## Development Guidelines

### 1) Code Style & Quality
- Python 3.11+ preferred.
- Full type annotations for new code.
- Lint/format: ruff (format + lint).
- Type check: mypy.
- Tests: pytest.

Recommended commands:

```bash
ruff format .
ruff check .
mypy src/
pytest
```

### 2) Configuration Rules
- Agent configs are treated as stable API.
- Backward compatible changes only unless explicitly versioned.
- Support env var overrides for all secrets and deployment-specific values.
- Validate configs early; fail fast with actionable errors.

### 3) Networking & Scraping
- Always use timeouts and retries.
- Identify a clear User-Agent.
- Respect robots.txt where feasible and do not implement brittle scraping as the default.
- Prefer RSS/APIs over HTML scraping when available.
- Cache fetches during a run to avoid repeated requests.

### 4) Ranking

Ranking should be deterministic and explainable by default:
- recency score (within window)
- query match score (title/snippet)
- source authority heuristic (domain allowlist/denylist, or simple signals)
- novelty (dedupe + similarity suppression)

If an LLM is used:
- keep the prompt short and structured
- require a numeric score + short rationale
- never hallucinate URLs; URLs must come from sources

### 5) Summarization
- Output must be concise and link-first.
- Include dates when available (publish date, deadline, etc.).
- Each item should include: title, link, 1–2 bullets, optional key date(s).

### 6) Notification
- Email: support both plain text and HTML where possible.
- Telegram: keep within message length limits; split if needed.
- Never log secrets (SMTP passwords, bot tokens).

### 7) Observability
- Structured logs (JSON optional) with run id, agent name, timing, counts.
- Metrics (optional): fetched, deduped, ranked, delivered, failures.

### Adding a new source provider

### Adding a new notifier
<TBA>

## Secrets & Configuration
- Never commit secrets.
- Prefer .env locally; environment variables in CI/deploy.
- Common env vars (example naming):

```
BLOOMPSCHMAPF_SMTP_HOST
BLOOMPSCHMAPF_SMTP_PORT
BLOOMPSCHMAPF_SMTP_USER
BLOOMPSCHMAPF_SMTP_PASS
BLOOMPSCHMAPF_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
BLOOMPSCHMAPF_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID
BLOOMPSCHMAPF_WEBSEARCH_API_KEY
```

---

## Testing
- Unit tests for config validation, dedupe, ranking determinism, and rendering.
- Integration smoke test for pipeline with mocked HTTP.
- No live network calls in tests by default.

Suggested targets:

```bash
pytest -q
pytest -q -k pipeline
```

---

## Branching & Workflow
- Work in feature branches: feature/<desc> / bugfix/<desc>
- Keep PRs small and test-backed.
- Update README + example config when adding user-facing behavior.

---

## Additional Instructions
- This file is committed to the repository and must not include secrets.
- Prefer explicit, readable code over cleverness.
- Never fabricate links or references in reports.
- Always include a "run metadata" footer in reports (agent name, window, run time, counts).
- Keep outputs concise; optimize for scanability.
